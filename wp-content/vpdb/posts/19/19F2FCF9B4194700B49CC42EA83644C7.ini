Big Brothers Big Sisters recognizes that online social media (Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, LinkedIn, Blogs, etc) has become a very popular communications tool and that many of our Big Brothers/Sisters and Little Brothers/Sisters use these websites.  In general, personal use of social media sites is typically for communications between peers, including friends and family.  BBBS wants to reiterate that your relationship with your Little is that of a mentor and role model, in addition to a friend.  Not all social media sites are designed to support mentoring relationships.

Please proceed thoughtfully when inviting or accepting an invitation from your Little or their parent to a social media site.  If you have any doubts, please contact your Match Support Specialist and/or postpone your invitation or acceptance.  If you choose to participate in a social media site with your Little or their parent, you must adhere to the following guidelines regarding any postings related to your match or affiliation with BBBS:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Child safety must be a top priority at all times.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Do not participate in any online communication with/about your Little unless you have discussed this with the parent/guardian or Match Support Specialist and have received their approval.</li>
 	<li>Never post any pictures of your Little online unless you have written consent from the child’s parent/guardian.  That consent form should be filed with BBBS.</li>
 	<li>Never post any identifying information about your Little, especially contact information (ie: child’s home address, school the child attends, where the parent works, etc.).</li>
 	<li>If you allow your Little to have access to the internet or social media during your match activity, you are responsible for monitoring the usage and assuring that your Little is on appropriate sites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>You are responsible for acting as a role model at all times.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Use sound judgment with your communication, as you are a representing Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa, even if the agency isn’t directly connected to the message.</li>
 	<li>Never post anything that could be perceived as judgmental or offensive to your Little or his/her parent/guardian.</li>
 	<li>Be aware of other postings on your page that are not BBBS related or are inappropriate for minors. Know that as a BBBS volunteer you are a role model at all times. Please ensure that all contents are appropriate and kid-friendly, in case your Little or his/her family were to read your social media page. If the social media site allows, create a separate group for your Little, his/her parent/guardian and BBBS staff that limits your Little’s access to your general or universal postings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Parent/Guardian permission is required.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Give the parent/guardian and BBBS your website address, and when possible link your page to the BBBS page on that site so that we can follow along with your postings. We are active on Facebook, Twitter and our blog.</li>
 	<li>Make sure that your page settings are set to private, so that only people you approve can view your online content. Ensure that BBBS and the parent/guardian are approved if you plan to post content related to your match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Confidentiality must be maintained at all times.</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Do not post the last name of a Little or their family, including but not limited to tagging them in a post or photo.</li>
 	<li>Honor confidentiality guidelines within your match: be cautious when posting detailed information about conversations with your Little, their parent/guardian, or with BBBS staff.  Posting generalized information or status updates is typically appropriate, but lengthier postings or blogs containing in-depth information should be approved by the parent/guardian and by BBBS prior to posting.</li>
 	<li>Do not post information that can only be assessed through Big Deals, Match Activities emails or through BBBS newsletters. The opportunities posted on Big Deals and Match Activities are intended for current Bigs only, not the general public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>When in doubt about whether or not something is appropriate to post, consult with your Match Support Specialist prior to posting.</strong></li>
</ol>
Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in the termination of your match.
