post_content = "Big Brothers Big Sisters is a program designed to help children who have a defined need for a strong relationship with an interested adult.

<strong>‘Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa impacts youth by empowering them to discover and achieve their goals through meaningful mentoring relationships.’</strong> – Mission Statement

The evaluation interviews are designed to establish a profile of your capacities in relating to children and your interests. Except for parents and/or guardians with a direct responsibility for a Little Brother/Sister who has been evaluated, approved for a match, and is actively being considered for a match with you, the information you provide the agency will be handled in a confidential manner.

The desires of a child’s parent or guardian and the wishes of the Big Brother or Big Sister are respected in the selection of the appropriate adult and child to be matched. Relevant information will be provided to each party in a prospective match regarding the other, but names will be withheld until the parties agree to enter into a pre-match discussion. Relevant information shall include past or present factors of health, personality, behavior of each individual and/or family that your Case Manager determines may have a significant effect on the relationship. Any party has the right to refuse to enter into the match based upon the information communicated.

Big Brothers Big Sister of Central Iowa maintains supervision after the match is made. During the supervision of the match, your Case Manager will share relevant information that, in their opinion, will be necessary to help the relationship depend and/or resolve problems.

All parties in the match, including staff members of Big Brothers Big Sisters, will handle information in a confidential and appropriate manner.
